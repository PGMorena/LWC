#The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:
   1. Core DOM
   2. XML DOM
   3. HTML DOM
   
No	DOM Type	Purpose/Use of DOM
1.	Core DOM-->	Standard Model for Accessing any Structured Document.
2.	HTML DOM-->	Standard Model for Accessing HTML Document.
3.	XML DOM-->	Standard Model for Accessing XML Document.
